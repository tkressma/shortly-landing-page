## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Component-Scoped Styles with CSS Modules
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Axios - Promise-based library for asynchronous HTTP requests
- [t.ly API](https://t.ly/home)


### What I learned

This project helped me realize the importance of pseudoelements in quirky landing page designs.

The section "Advanced Statistics" took a while to figure out how I was going to implement it, but I am very happy with the way it came out - including its responsiveness.

As with every one of these projects, I aimed to implement the figma design as accurately as possible, pixel for pixel. In the end, my design is nearly 100% accurate to the design given to me. My flexbox and grid skills have continued to improve with each project I take on, and I am discovering that it is easier to not overcomplicate the implementation of designs in my HTML/CSS now.

### Continued development

The paid-for t.ly API includes more advanced statistics with each shortened link - such as how many people used the link, the location in which the click originated, ect. If I were to have access to the premium service, I would have included more details for each shortened link.
